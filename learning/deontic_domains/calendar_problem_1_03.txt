Scenario:
In a marketing agency, there are three team members: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The company also has a creative team called "Designers". They have three upcoming events: a brainstorming session, a team lunch, and a client presentation. Alice is the organizer of the brainstorming session, and Charlie is a participant in the team lunch. The creative team "Designers" is a group participant in the client presentation. The brainstorming session is a short event, while the team lunch is a long event. Bob is busy during the client presentation. The brainstorming session is categorized as a meeting, and the team lunch is a social event. Alice sets a reminder for a few hours before the brainstorming session.
For this agency, the following rules apply:
If a person is the organizer of an event, it is obligatory for them to add themselves as a participant.
If a group is a participant in an event, it is permissible to delegate the event to the group.
If a person is busy during an event, it is impermissible for them to set a reminder for minutes before the event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible to remove them as a participant.
For short events, it is permissible to update the event to be a social event.
If a person's availability is tentative for an event, it is obligatory to check their availability before scheduling the event.
If a person has a high priority for an event, it is obligatory to set a reminder for days before the event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible for them to suggest an alternative time for the event.
If an event is public, it is obligatory to add Alice as a participant.
