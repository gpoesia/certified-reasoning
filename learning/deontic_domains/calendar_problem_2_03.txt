Scenario:
In a university, there are three professors: Prof. Adams, Prof. Brown, and Prof. Clark. They also have a research group called "Humanities". They have three upcoming events: a department event, a research event, and a workshop on a new research method. Prof. Brown is the organizer of the research event. Prof. Clark is a participant in the workshop. The department event occurs every month, whereas the research event occurs every year. Prof. Adams considers the workshop as high priority. The research event is a conference. Prof. Adams recieves an individual invite to the research event, and the research group "Humanities" receives group invitations to the workshop.
For this university, the following rules apply:
If a person is the organizer of an event, it is permissible to add Prof. Adams as a participant in that event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is obligatory to set a reminder for a few days before the event.
If an event has high priority for a person, it is obligatory to check that person's availability for that event.
If a person is busy during an event, it is impermissible for them to accept individual invitations to that event.
If a person is free during an event, it is permissible for them to suggest an alternative time for the event.
If a group is a participant in an event, it is obligatory to remove Prof. Clark as a participant.
If an event is public, it is permissible to change the event's visibility to private.
If an event has low priority for a person, it is permissible to reschedule the event to be yearly.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible to delegate the event to them.
If Prof. Adams is the organizer of an event, Prof. Clark is a participant in that event.
If a group is a participant in an event, the event is a conference.
If an event is monthly, Prof. Brown is busy during that event.
If Prof. Brown is the organizer of an event, the event is yearly.
If an event has high priority for Prof. Adams, the event is public.
Question:
Given the situation and the rules of the world, is it impermissible for Prof. Brown to accept an individual invitation to the department event?
Solution:
To determine whether it is impermissible for Prof. Brown (b2) to accept an individual invitation to the department event (f1), we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom3 f1 rec3) : (busy b2 f1) – This states that Prof. Brown (b2) is busy during the department event (f1) since it is a monthly event.
(daxiom15 f1 b2 r1) : (impermissible (accept (individual_invite b2 f1))) – This states that it is impermissible for Prof. Brown (b2) to accept an individual invitation to the department event (f1) since he is busy during that event.
Answer:
Yes, it is impermissible for Prof. Brown to accept an individual invitation to the  department event (f1).
