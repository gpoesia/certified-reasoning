Scenario:
In a clinic, there are three healthcare professionals: Adams, Baker, and Paramedic Clark. They are attending to two patients: Patient Emily and Patient Frank. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: a blood pressure monitor and an X-ray machine. Emily has been prescribed medication. Frank has to undergo surgery. Adams is working in an area with high resources, while Baker is working in an area with low resources. Frank has a critical condition. Frank is immobile. Adams has been assigned to care for Emily. Adams is initiating rehabilitation for Emily. Baker is responsible for Frank. Baker is providing palliative care for Frank.

Here are the rules of the world in this scenario:
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to assign them a red priority.
If a patient has stable vitals, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to assign them a green priority.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to create a treatment plan for an immobile patient.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is not obligatory for them to assign a green priority to a patient.
If the healthcare professional has high resources, it is permissible for them to administer treatment to Emily.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to discharge a conscious patient.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is impermissible for them to initiate rehabilitation for a patient.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned care for Emily, it is not obligatory for them to use equipment for Emily.
If a patient has stable vitals, they are given a green priority.
If a patient has a moderate condition, they are conscious.
If Frank is immobile, he has a moderate condition.
If Frank is conscious, he has stable vitals.
If a patient is being treated with medication, they have stable vitals.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned care for a patient, the patient is in a critical condition.

Question:
Is it obligatory for Paramedic Clark to assign a green priority to Emily?

Solution:
To determine whether it is obligatory for Paramedic Clark to assign a green priority to Emily, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom9 p1 t1) : (stable_vitals p1) - This states that Emily has stable vitals as she is on medication.
(daxiom2 h3 p1 r1) : (obligatory (assign_green h3 p1)) - This states that it is obligatory for a healthcare professional (in this case, Paramedic Clark) to assign a green priority to a patient with stable vitals (Emily).

Answer:
Yes, it is obligatory for Paramedic Clark to assign a green priority to Emily.
