The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: a blood pressure monitor and an ultrasound machine. Emily is undergoing physical therapy. Frank has been prescribed medication. Adams is working in an area with a high number of staff members, while Baker is working in an area with low resources. Emily has unstable vitals, and Frank has a stable condition. Emily is unconscious, and Frank is mobile. Adams has been assigned to care for Emily. Adams is initiating rehabilitation for Emily. Baker is responsible for Frank. Baker is providing mental health support for Frank.

(taxiom2 p4 stab2) : (conscious p4) - This states that Frank is conscious because he has a stable condition.
(taxiom5 p4 r1) : (moderate p4) - This states that Frank has a moderate condition because he is conscious.
(taxiom4 h4 p4 r2) : (no_follow_up_plan h4 p4) - This states that Adams has no follow-up plan for Frank.
(daxiom20 h4 p4 r3) : (permissible (provide_family_support h4 p4)) - This states that it is permissible for Adams to provide family support for Frank because there is no follow-up plan for Frank.
