Scenario:
In a clinic, there are three healthcare professionals: Brown, Green, and White. They are attending to two patients: Patient Carol and Patient Dave. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: an X-ray machine and a blood pressure monitor. Carol is undergoing physical therapy, while Dave has been prescribed medication. Brown is working in a ward with low resources, while Green is working in a ward with high resources. Carol has a stable condition but is unconscious. Dave has unstable vitals. Carol is mobile. Dave has been assigned a green priority. Green has been assigned to care for Carol. Green is providing mental health support for Carol.
Here are the rules of the world:
If a patient has unstable vitals, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to assign them an orange priority.
If a patient is unconscious, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to perform an examination on them.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is impermissible for them to administer treatment to a patient.
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to monitor them.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to discharge a conscious patient.
If a healthcare professional is assigned care for Carol, it is obligatory for them to use equipment for Carol.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is impermissible for them to monitor a patient.
If a patient has a stable condition, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to create a treatment plan for them.
If a patient has stable vitals, they have a stable condition.
If a patient has unstable vitals, they have a critical condition.
If a patient has a stable condition, they are given a green priority.
If a healthcare professional is assigned care for a patient, they have a follow-up plan for the patient.
Question:
Is it permissible for White to monitor Dave?
Solution:
To determine whether it is permissible for White to monitor Dave, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom2 p4 crit2) : (critical_condition p4) - This states that Dave has a critical condition as he has unstable vitals.
(daxiom16 h6 p4 r1) : (permissible (monitor_patient h6 p4)) - This states that it is permissible for White to monitor Dave since he is in a critical condition.
Answer:
Yes, it is permissible for White to monitor Dave.
