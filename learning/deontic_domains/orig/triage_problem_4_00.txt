Scenario:
In a hospital, there are three healthcare professionals: Smith, Johnson, and  Williams. They are attending to two patients: Patient Alice and Patient Bob. The hospital has two pieces of medical equipment: an EKG machine and an MRI scanner.  Alice has been prescribed medication. Bob has to undergo surgery. Smith is working in a ward with high resources, while Johnson is working in a ward with low resources. Bob has a critical condition. Bob is immobile. Smith has been assigned to care for Alice. Smith is initiating rehabilitation for Alice. Johnson is responsible for Bob. Johnson is providing palliative care for Bob.
Here are the rules of the world:
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to assign them a red priority.
If a patient has stable vitals, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to assign them a green priority.
If a Alice is unconscious, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to perform an examination on her.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to create a treatment plan for an immobile patient.
If the healthcare professional has high resources, it is permissible for them to administer treatment to Alice.
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is obligatory for Johnson to monitor them.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to discharge a conscious patient.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is impermissible for them to initiate rehabilitation for a patient.
If a patient is mobile, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to discharge them.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned care for Alice, it is not obligatory for them to use equipment for Alice.
If a patient is in a critical condition, they are given a red priority.
If a patient has stable vitals, they are given a green priority.
If a patient is given a green priority, they are conscious.
If Bob is immobile, he has a moderate condition.
If a healthcare professional has high resources, they are a general practitioner.
If a patient is in a critical condition, they have unstable vitals.
If Bob is conscious, he has stable vitals.
If a healthcare professional has low resources, they are a nurse.
If a patient is being treated with medication, they have stable vitals.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned care for a patient, the patient is in a critical condition.
Question:
Is it not obligatory for Johnson to discharge Alice?
Solution:
To determine whether it is not obligatory Johnson to discharge Alice, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom9 p1 t1) : (stable_vitals p1) - This states that Alice has stable vitals as she is on medication.
(taxiom2 p1 r1) : (green p1) - This states that Alice has been assigned green status as she has stable vitals.
(taxiom3 p1 r2) : (conscious p1) - This states that Alice is conscious because she has been assigned a green status.
(daxiom7 h2 p1 r3) : (not (obligatory (discharge_patient h2 p1))) - This states that it is not obligatory for Johnson to discharge Alice because they are conscious.
Answer:
Yes, it is not obligatory for Johnson to discharge Alice.
