Scenario:
In a clinic, there are two healthcare professionals: Adams and Brown. They are attending to two patients: Patient Claire and Patient Diana. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: an ultrasound machine and a blood pressure monitor. Claire is receiving physical therapy. Diana is on medication. Adams is working in a ward with low resources. Claire has a stable condition but is unconscious. Diana is mobile. Claire is infected. Diana, who is pregnant, is also a patient at the clinic.
Here are the rules of the world:
If a patient is pregnant, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to discharge them.
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to perform an examination on them.
If a patient has a stable condition, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to assign them a green priority.
If a patient is infected, it is impermissible for the healthcare professional to discharge them.
If a patient is pregnant, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to initiate rehabilitation for them.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is not obligatory for them to administer treatment to a patient.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned care for Claire, it is not obligatory for them to use equipment for Claire.
If a patient is infected, they have unstable vitals.
If a patient has a stable condition, they are conscious.
If a healthcare professional has high resources, they are assigned care for the patient.
If a healthcare professional assesses a patient's mental health, the patient has an unstable mental state.
If a patient is assigned an orange priority by Adams, they are in a critical condition.
If a patient has unstable vitals, Adams assigns them an orange priority.
