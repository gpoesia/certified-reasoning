Scenario:
In a rural clinic, there are two healthcare professionals: Taylor and Lee. They are attending to two patients: Patient Claire and Patient David. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: an ultrasound machine and a blood pressure monitor. Claire requires physical therapy. David has been prescribed medication. Taylor is working in a ward with low resources. Claire has a stable condition but is unconscious. David is mobile. Claire is infected. David's wife is pregnant.
Here are the rules of the world:
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to perform an examination on them.
If a patient is pregnant, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to initiate rehabilitation for them.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is not obligatory for them to administer treatment to the patient.
If the healthcare professional has high resources, it is obligatory for them to discharge the patient.
If a patient is mobile, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to create a treatment plan for them.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to discharge a conscious patient.
If a patient is unconscious, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to monitor them.
If a healthcare professional is assigned care for a patient, it is obligatory for them to provide family support for the patient.
If a patient is infected, they have unstable vitals.
If a patient is pregnant, they have unstable vitals.
If a patient has a stable condition, they are conscious.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned care for a conscious patient, they do not have to provide family support.
If a healthcare professional declares an emergency, the patient is in a critical condition.
If a patient has unstable vitals, Taylor assigns them an orange priority.
