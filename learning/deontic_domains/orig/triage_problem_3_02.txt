In a medical clinic, there are three healthcare professionals: Adams, Brown, and Carter. They are attending to two patients: Patient Claire and Patient David. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: an X-ray machine and an ultrasound machine. Claire is undergoing physical therapy. David has been prescribed medication. Adams is working in a ward with low resources, while Brown is working in a ward with high resources. Claire has a stable condition. David has unstable vitals. Claire is unconscious. David is mobile. David has been assigned a green priority. Brown has been assigned to care for Claire. Brown is providing mental health support for Claire.
Here are the rules of the world:
If a patient has a stable condition, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to assign them a yellow priority.

If a patient is mobile, it is not obligatory for the healthcare professional to initiate rehabilitation for the patient.
If a patient is unconscious, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to perform an examination on them.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is impermissible for them to check the patient's history.
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to monitor them.
If a healthcare professional is assigned care for Claire, it is obligatory for them to use equipment for her.
If a healthcare professional is assigned care for a patient, it is permissible for them to check the patient's history.
If a patient has a stable condition, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to create a treatment plan for them.
If a patient has stable vitals, they have a stable condition.
If a patient has unstable vitals, they have a critical condition.
If a healthcare professional is a paramedic and a patient has a green priority, they are assigned care for the patient.
If a healthcare professional has high resources, they are a paramedic.
If a patient has a stable condition, they have a green priority.
If a patient has an orange priority, Carter is assigned care for the patient.
Question:
Is it permissible for Brown to check David's patient history?
Solution:
To determine whether it is permissible for Brown to check David's patient history, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom4 h5 res4) : (paramedic h5) - This states that Brown is a paramedic because they work in a ward with high resources.
(taxiom3 h5 p4 cond2 r1) : (assigned_care h5 p4) - This states that Brown is assigned care for David because David has a green priority and Brown is a paramedic.
(daxiom19 h5 p4 r2) : (permissible (check_patient_history h5 p4)) - This states that it is permissible for Brown to check David's patient history because they are assigned care for David.
Answer:
Yes, it is permissible for Brown to check David's patient history.
