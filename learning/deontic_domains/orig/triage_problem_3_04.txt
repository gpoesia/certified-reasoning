Scenario:
In a small clinic, there are two healthcare professionals: Martin and Brown. They are attending to two patients: Patient Claire and Patient David. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: an ultrasound machine and a blood pressure monitor. Claire has been prescribed physical therapy. David has been prescribed medication. Martin is working in a ward with low resources. Claire has a stable condition but is unconscious. David is mobile. Claire is infected. David's wife is pregnant.
Here are the rules of the world:
If a patient is in a critical condition, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to perform an examination on them.
If a patient is infected, it is impermissible for the healthcare professional to discharge them.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned to care for David, it is permissible for them to use equipment for Claire.
If the healthcare professional has low resources, it is not obligatory for them to administer treatment to a patient.
If a patient is mobile, it is permissible for the healthcare professional to create a treatment plan for them.
If a healthcare professional is not assigned care for Claire, it is impermissible for them to use equipment for Claire.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to discharge a conscious patient.
If a healthcare professional is assigned care for a patient, it is obligatory for them to provide family support for the patient.
If a patient is infected, they have unstable vitals.
If a patient is pregnant, they have unstable vitals.
If a patient has a stable condition, they are conscious.
If a healthcare professional has high resources, they are assigned care for a patient.
If a patient is conscious, the healthcare professional is not assigned care for them.
If a healthcare professional provides family support for a patient, the patient has a stable mental state.
If a patient has unstable vitals, they are assigned an orange priority by Martin.
Question:
Is it impermissible for Martin to use the blood pressure monitor for Claire?
Solution:
To determine whether it is impermissible for Martin to use the blood pressure monitor for Claire, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom3 p3 stab2) : (conscious p3) - This states that Claire is conscious because she has a stable condition.
(taxiom4 h4 p3 r1) : (not_assigned_care h4 p3) - This states that Martin is not assigned care for Claire because Claire is conscious.
(daxiom17 h4 eq4 r2) : (impermissible (use_equipment h4 p3 eq4)) - This states that it is impermissible for Martin to use the blood pressure monitor for Claire because he is not assigned care for her.
Answer:
Yes, it is impermissible for Martin to use the blood pressure monitor for Claire.
