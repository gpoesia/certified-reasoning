Scenario:
In a clinic, there are three healthcare professionals: Adams, Brown, and Clark. They are attending to two patients: Patient Emily and Patient Frank. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: a blood pressure monitor and an X-ray machine. Emily is undergoing physical therapy, while Frank has been prescribed medication. Adams is working with high staff levels, while Brown is working with low resources. Emily has unstable vitals, while Frank has a stable condition. Emily is unconscious. Frank is mobile. Adams has been assigned to care for Emily, and is initiating rehabilitation for her. Brown is responsible for Frank and is providing mental health support for him.

Here are the rules of the world:
If a patient has unstable vitals, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to assign them a red priority.
If Emily is unconscious, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to perform an examination on her.
If a healthcare professional has low resources, it is impermissible for them to administer treatment to a patient.
If a patient is undergoing physical therapy, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to discharge them.
If a patient has unstable vitals, it is obligatory for the healthcare professional to monitor them.
It is not obligatory for a healthcare professional to discharge a conscious patient.
If a healthcare professional has no follow-up plan for a patient, it is obligatory for them to provide family support for the patient.

If a patient has unstable vitals, they have a critical condition.
If a patient has a stable condition, they are conscious.
If a healthcare professional has high resources, they have high staff levels.
If a patient has a moderate condition, the healthcare professional has no follow-up plan for them.
If a healthcare professional is providing mental health support for a patient, the patient has an unstable mental state.
