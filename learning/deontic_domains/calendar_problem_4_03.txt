Scenario:
In a company, there are three employees: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The company has a group called "ProjectTeam". They have two upcoming events: a public social event and another short event. Alice is the organizer of the social event, and Bob is a participant in the social event. The ProjectTeam is also a participant in the social event. Alice has set a reminder for a few hours before the social event. The social event is public.
For this company, the following rules apply:
If a person is the organizer of an event, it is obligatory to add them as a participant.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible for them to accept an individual invitation to the event.
If an event is short, it is impermissible to cancel the event.

If a person is free during an event, it is permissible to set a reminder for a few hours before the event.
If a person is busy during an event, it is impermissible to reschedule the event daily.
If an event is public, it is obligatory to check Alice's availability for that event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible for to delegate the event to them.
If a person has a tentative status for an event, it is permissible for them to suggest an alternative time.
If an event has high priority for a person, it is obligatory to set a reminder for the person a few days before the event.
If an event is short, it is a meeting.
If an event is a meeting, then a person has a tentative status for that event.
If Alice has a tentative status for an event, then she is a participant in that event. 
If a person is free during an event, they have low priority for that event.
If an event is public, it is a social event.

If a person is a participant in an event and is also the organizer, they are not a group participant.
If an event is daily, it is not a weekly event.
If an event is weekly, it is not a monthly event.
If a person sets a reminder for a few hours before an event, they do not set a reminder for a few days before the event.
Question:
Given the situation and the rules of the world, is it permissible to delegate the short event to Alice?
Solution:
To determine whether it is permissible to delegate the short meeting (f2) to Alice, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom11 f2 short1) : (meeting f2) – This states that the short event (f2) is a meeting because it is a short event.
(taxiom12 f2 b1 r1) : (tentative b1 f2) – This states that Alice (b1) has a tentative status for the short event (f2) because it is a meeting.
(taxiom13 f2 r2) : (participant f2 b1) – This states that Alice (b1) is a participant in the short event (f2) due to her tentative status.
(daxiom18 f2 b1 r3) : (permissible (delegate_event f2 b1)) – This states that it is permissible (b1) to delegate the short event (f2) to Alice since she is a participant.
Answer:
Yes, it is permissible for Alice (b1) to delegate the short meeting (f2).
