Scenario:
In a software company, there are three employees: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The company has a group of employees called the "DevTeam". They have two upcoming events: a team-building activity and a project meeting. Alice is the organizer of the team-building activity, and Bob is a participant. The DevTeam is also participating in the team-building activity. The project meeting is a short event. The team-building activity is a social event, and its visibility is public. Alice sets a reminder a few hours before the team-building activity.

For this software company, the following rules apply:
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible for them to accept an individual invite to the event.
If an event is short, it is impermissible to cancel the event.
If a person is free during an event, it is permissible to set a reminder for a few hours before the event.
If a person is busy during an event, it is impermissible to reschedule the event daily.
If an event is public, it is obligatory to check the availability of Alice for that event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible to delegate the event to them.
If a person is busy for an event, it is impermissible to delegate the event to them.
If a person has a tentative status for an event, it is permissible for them to suggest an alternative time for the event.
If an event has high priority for a person, it is obligatory to set a reminder for a few days before the event.

If an event is short, it is a meeting.
If an event is a meeting, then a person has a tentative status for it.
If Alice has a tentative status for an event, she is a participant in that event.
If a person is free during an event, they have low priority for that event.
If an event is public, it is a social event.
If an event is private, it is a personal event.
If an event is daily, it is not a weekly event.
If an event is weekly, it is not a monthly event.
If a person sets a reminder for a few hours before an event, they do not set a reminder for a few days before the event.

Question:
Given the situation and the rules of the world, is it permissible to delegate the project meeting to Alice?

Solution:
To determine whether it is permissible to delegate the project meeting (f2) to Alice, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom11 f2 short1) : (meeting f2) – This states that the project meeting (f2) is a meeting since it is a short event.
(taxiom12 f2 b1 r1) : (tentative b1 f2) – This states that Alice (b1) has a tentative status for the project meeting (f2) since it is a meeting.
(taxiom13 f2 r2) : (participant f2 b1) – This states that Alice (b1) is a participant in the project meeting (f2) since she has a tentative status for that event.
(daxiom18 f2 b1 r3) : (permissible (delegate_event f2 b1)) – This states that it is permissible to delegate the project meeting (f2) to Alice since she is a participant.

Answer:
Yes, it is permissible to delegate the project meeting to Alice.
