Scenario:
In a software development company, there are three team members: John, Sarah, and Emily. The company also has a development team called "FrontendDevelopers". They have three upcoming events: a project event, a team building event, and a code review session. John is the organizer of the project event, and Emily is a participant in the team building event. The development team "FrontendDevelopers" is a group participant in the code review session. The project event is a short event, while the team building event is a long event. Sarah is busy during the code review session. The project event is categorized as a meeting, and the team building event is a social event. John sets a reminder for a few hours before the project meeting.
For this company, the following rules apply:
If a person is the organizer of an event, it is obligatory for them to add themselves as a participant.
If a person is free during an event, it is permissible for them to accept the event.
If a group is a participant in an event, it is permissible to delegate the event to the group.
If a person is busy during an event, it is impermissible for them to set a reminder for minutes before the event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible to remove them as a participant.
For short events, it is permissible to update the event to be a social event.
If a person has a high priority for an event, it is obligatory to set a reminder for days before the event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible for them to suggest an alternative time for the event.
If an event is a meeting, it is impermissible for a person to suggest an alternative time for the event.
If an event is public, it is obligatory to add John as a participant.
Question:
Given the situation and the rules of the world, is it permissible for Emily to suggest an alternative time for the team building event?
Solution:
To determine whether it is permissible for Emily (b3) to suggest an alternative time for the team building event (e5), we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(daxiom19 e5 b3 part2) : (permissible (suggest_alternative_time b3 e5)) â€“ This states that it is permissible for Emily (b3) to suggest an alternative time for the team building event (e5) since she is a participant in the event.
Answer:
Yes, it is permissible for Emily to suggest an alternative time for the team building event.
