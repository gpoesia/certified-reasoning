Scenario:
In a software development company, there are three team members: Anna, Brian, and Carol. The company also has a human resources team called "HR". They have three upcoming events: a project kickoff, a review event, and a team-building activity. Brian is the organizer of the  review event, and Carol is a participant in the team-building activity. The project kickoff is a monthly event, while the review event is a yearly. The project kickoff is categorized as a conference, and it is a short event. The team-building activity is a long event. Anna sets a reminder for a few hours before the project kickoff, while Brian sets a reminder for a few days before the review event. Anna is busy during the project kickoff, and Brian is free during the team-building activity. The team-building activity is a public event, while the project kickoff is a private event.
For this software development company, the following rules apply:
If a person is busy during an event, it is permissible for them to add themselves as a participant.
If a person is free during an event, it is impermissible for them to add themselves as a participant.
If a person has a low priority for an event, it is obligatory for them to set a reminder for days before the event.
If an event is a conference, it is impermissible to update the event to be public.
If a person has a low priority for an event, it is obligatory to cancel the event.
For short events, it is impermissible to reschedule the event as a daily event.
If an event is private, it is obligatory to reschedule the event as a daily event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible to request an update for the event from them.
If a person is the organizer of an event, it is obligatory for them to change the event's visibility to private.
If an event is long, it is permissible to reschedule the event as a daily event.
Question:
Given the situation and the rules of the world, is it obligatory to reschedule the project kickoff as a daily event?
Solution:
To determine whether it is obligatory to reschedule the project kickoff (f1) as a daily event, we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(daxiom18 f1 vis2) : (obligatory (reschedule_event f1 daily)) â€“ This states that it is obligatory to reschedule the project kickoff (f1) as a daily event since it is a private event.
Answer:
Yes, it is obligatory to reschedule the project kickoff as a daily event.
