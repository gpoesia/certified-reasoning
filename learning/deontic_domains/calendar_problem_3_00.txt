Question:
Given the situation and the rules of the world, is it obligatory to check Manager Alice's availability for the status update?

Solution:
To determine whether it is obligatory to check Manager Alice's availability for the  status update (e3), we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(taxiom2 e3 rec1) : (long e3) – This states that the status update (e3) is a long event since it occurs daily.
(taxiom3 e3 r1) : (private e3) – This states that the status update (e3) is a private event since it is a long event.
(daxiom10 e3 r2) : (obligatory (check_availability a1 e3)) – This states that it is obligatory to check Manager Alice's availability for the status update (e3) since it is a private event.

Answer:
Yes, it is obligatory to check Manager Alice's availability for the daily status update (e3).
