Scenario:
In a company, there are three employees: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. They also have a team called "Marketing". They have three upcoming events: a product launch, a team event, and a training session. Bob is the organizer of the team event, and Charlie is a participant in the training session. The product launch occurs monthly, while the team event occurs yearly. The product launch is categorized as a conference event. The product launch is a short event, while the training session is a long event. Alice sets a reminder for a few hours before the product launch, and Bob sets a reminder for a few days before the team event. Alice is busy during the product launch, while Bob is free during the training session. The training session is a public event, and the product launch is a private event.

If an event is short, it is impermissible to reschedule the event to occur yearly.
If an event is private, it is obligatory to remove Charlie as a participant.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible to request an event update from them.
If Alice is the organizer of an event, it is obligatory to change the event's visibility to confidential.
