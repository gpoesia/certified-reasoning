Context: In a small clinic, Martin and Brown are healthcare professionals who are attending to two patients: Patient Claire and Patient David. Claire has been prescribed physical therapy, has a stable condition, but is unconscious and infected. David has been prescribed medication, is mobile, and his wife is pregnant. The clinic has two pieces of medical equipment: an ultrasound machine and a blood pressure monitor. If a patient is in critical condition, the healthcare professional must examine them. If a patient is infected, they cannot be discharged. If a healthcare professional is not assigned to care for a patient, they can use equipment for that patient. If the healthcare professional has low resources, they do not have to provide treatment. If a patient is mobile, the healthcare professional can create a treatment plan for that patient. If the healthcare professional is not assigned care for a patient, they cannot use equipment for that patient. If a patient has a stable condition, they are conscious. If a healthcare professional has high resources, they are assigned care for a patient. If a patient is conscious, the healthcare professional is not assigned care for them. If a healthcare professional provides family support for a patient, the patient has a stable mental state. If a patient is infected or pregnant, they have unstable vitals. If a patient has unstable vitals, they are assigned an orange priority by Martin.
