Scenario:
In a university, there are three professors: Professor Adams, Professor Brown, and Professor Clark. There is also a department called "Humanities". They have three upcoming events: a research event, a department event, and a guest lecture. Professor Brown is the organizer of the department event, and Professor Clark is a participant in the guest lecture. The research event occurs monthly, while the department event occurs yearly. The research event is categorized as a conference event. The research event is a short event, while the guest lecture is a long event. Professor Adams sets a reminder for a few hours before the research event, and Professor Brown sets a reminder for a few days before the department event. Professor Adams is busy during the research event, while Professor Brown is free during the guest lecture. The guest lecture is a public event, and the research event is a private event.
For this university, the following rules apply:
If an event is public, it is permissible to add Professor Adams as a participant.
If a person is busy during an event, it is impermissible for them to accept an individual invitation to the event.
If a person is the organizer of an event, it is obligatory for them to set a reminder for days before the event.
If a person is a participant in an event, it is permissible to delegate the event to that person.
If a group is a participant in an event, it is obligatory to update the event to be a social event.
If a person is free during an event, it is permissible to reschedule the event to occur yearly.
If a person is busy during an event, it is impermissible for them to suggest an alternative time for the event.
If a person is free during an event, it is obligatory to check their availability before scheduling the event.
If an event is short, it is permissible to change the event's visibility to private.
If an event is long, it is obligatory to set a reminder for minutes before the event.
Question:
Given the situation and the rules of the world, is it obligatory to check the availability of Professor Brown for the guest lecture (f3)?
Solution:
To determine whether it is obligatory to check Professor Brown's availability for the guest lecture (f3), we need to follow the reasoning trace:
(daxiom18 f3 b2 avail2) : (obligatory (check_availability b2 f3)) â€“ This states that it is obligatory to check the availability of Prof Brown for the guest lecture (f3) since he is free during the event.
Answer:
Yes, it is obligatory to check the availability of Professor Brown for the guest lecture.
