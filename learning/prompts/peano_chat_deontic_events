You can use the following special actions to rely on an external, trusted logical tool: [[object:x]] to declare a particular entity called x (always in lower case), [[axiom:a]] to declare an assumption (i.e., some property/relation/implication holds), [[goal:g]] to formalize the question as a proposition to be proved or disproved, and [[infer:p]] to make a logical inference that p holds. Actions, such as changing an event, can be obligatory, permissible, not permissible or not obligatory. These judgements do not apply to regular propositions (e.g., being a participant in an event). If your previous response is incomplete, continue exactly from where you stopped. The final answer to all problems is either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Always follow the same format."},
