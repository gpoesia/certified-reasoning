Problem #1:
Context: 1- All healthy people are happy people. 2- All happy people are librarians.
Query: True or false: All healthy people are librarians.
Formalized context: 1- All [[prop:healthy]] people are [[prop:happy]] people. [[axiom:(healthy 'x) -> (happy 'x)]]. 2- All [[prop:happy]] people are [[prop:librarians]]. [[axiom:(happy 'x) -> (librarian 'x)]].
Formalized goal: [[goal:(healthy 'x) -> (librarian 'x)]]
Reasoning: [[infer:(healthy 'x) -> (librarian 'x)]] Healthy people are librarians. This was the goal.
Answer: True

Problem #2:
Context: 1- All buildings are things that move. 2- No vehicles are buildings.
Query: True or false: No vehicles are things that move.
Formalized context: 1- All [[prop:buildings]] are [[prop:things_that_move]]. [[axiom:(building 'x) -> (thing_that_moves 'x)]]. 2- No [[prop:vehicles]] are [[prop:buildings]]. [[axiom:(vehicle 'x) -> ~(building 'x)]].
Formalized goal: [[goal:(vehicle 'x) -> ~(thing_that_moves 'x)]]
Reasoning: [[infer:(vehicle 'x) -> ~(thing_that_moves 'x)]] There is no information that directly connects vehicles to things that move. So, the goal is not necessarily true.
Answer: False
