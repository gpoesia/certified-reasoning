Problem #1:
Context: 1- All grosp are threck. 2- No crand are grosp.
Query: Can we logically conclude "No crand are threck"?
Formalized context: 1- All [[prop:grosp]] are [[prop:threck]]. [[axiom:(implies grosp threck)]] 2- No [[prop:crand]] are [[prop:grosp]]. [[axiom:(not (ex_some crand grosp))]]
Formalized goal: [[goal:(not (ex_some crand threck))]]
Reasoning: [[infer:nothing]] We cannot infer anything. So, the goal is not necessarily true.
Answer: False

Problem #2:
Context: 1- Some librarians are happy people. 2- All happy people are healthy people.
Query: Can we logically conclude "Some librarians are healthy people"?
Formalized context: 1- Some [[prop:librarian]] are [[prop:happy]] people. [[axiom:(ex_some librarian happy)]] 2- All [[prop:happy]] people are [[prop:healthy]] people. [[axiom:(implies happy healthy)]]
Formalized goal: [[goal:(ex_some librarian happy)]]
Reasoning: [[infer:(ex_some librarian healthy)]] Some librarians are healthy people. This was the goal.
Answer: True
###

Problem #3:
Context: 1- No buildings are things that move. 2- All things that move are vehicles.
Query: Can we logically conclude "No buildings are vehicles"?
Formalized context: 1- No [[prop:building]] are things that [[prop:move]]. [[axiom:(not (ex_some building move))]] 2- All things that [[prop:move]] are [[prop:vehicle]]. [[axiom:(implies move vehicle)]]
Formalized goal: [[goal:(not (ex_some building vehicle))]]
Reasoning: [[infer:nothing]] We cannot infer anything. So, the goal is not necessarily true.
Answer: False
