Problem #1:
Context: 1- Some librarians are happy people. 2- All happy people are healthy people.
Query: True or false: Some librarians are healthy people.
Formalized context: 1- Some [[prop:librarians]] are [[prop:happy]] people. [[axiom:(exist 'x) (and (librarian 'x) (happy 'x))]]. 2- All [[prop:happy]] people are [[prop:healthy]] people. [[axiom:(happy 'x) -> (healthy 'x)]].
Formalized goal: [[goal:(exist 'x) (and (librarian 'x) (healthy 'x))]]
Reasoning: [[infer:(exist 'x) (and (librarian 'x) (healthy 'x))]] Some librarians are healthy people. This was the goal.
Answer: True

Problem #2:
Context: 1- No buildings are things that move. 2- All things that move are vehicles.
Query: True or false: No buildings are vehicles.
Formalized context: 1- No [[prop:buildings]] are [[prop:things_that_move]]. [[axiom:(building 'x) -> ~(thing_that_moves 'x)]]. 2- All [[prop:things_that_move]] are [[prop:vehicles]]. [[axiom:(thing_that_moves 'x) -> (vehicle 'x)]].
Formalized goal: [[goal:(building 'x) -> ~(vehicle 'x)]]
Reasoning: [[infer:(building 'x) -> ~(vehicle 'x)]] There is no information that directly connects buildings vehicles. So, the goal is not necessarily true
Answer: False
